# Ash - Another Story (from) HackerNews

A simple iOS app that shows a random Hacker News story when opened.
This was really an excuse to demonstrate some things I'm interested in:
- MVVM
- Codable
- IBDesignable and IBInspectable

There's a lot of things I'd like to add to this project:
- Tests verifying request inputs
- Move all UI work to code
- Better tests around state changes
- Error propogation
- Accessibility

I may put this on the App Store eventually, but it's currently just a
braindump.
